**How to properly ask for help.**

~ Read the Docs first, seriously! dester.gq
~ Issues related to Dester only
~ Instead of taking a photo or pasting long code. Use one of these:
    yaso.su
    nekobin.com
    hastebin.com
    gist.github.com
    codepen.io
    jsfiddle.net

For getting feedback for your issue, your image must be:
- A issue which is new and not been fixed yet
- Uncompressed and clear

Do you agree to follow these rules and guidelines?
